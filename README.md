# 🧑‍🏫 TCP-based Attendance Monitoring System

This project implements a simple TCP-based attendance monitoring system using a multithreaded C server and Python clients. It allows students to mark their attendance by connecting via TCP, while a teacher dashboard displays live attendance and allows exporting to CSV.

## 🚀 Features

- TCP-based communication between server and clients
- Multithreaded server handling concurrent connections
- Roll number validation using `valid_rolls.txt`
- Live GUI dashboard for teacher (`Tkinter`)
- CSV export of attendance records
- Configurable cutoff time for marking attendance

---

## ⚙️ How to Run

### 1. Compile and Run the Server

```bash
gcc server.c -o server -lpthread
./server
````

You will be prompted to enter the allowed attendance marking duration in minutes.

### 2. Run a Student Client

```bash
python client.py
```

Enter your roll number when prompted.

### 3. Run the Teacher Dashboard

```bash
python teacher_dashboard.py
```

This GUI shows live attendance and allows exporting records to `attendance.csv`.

---

## 🧾 valid\_rolls.txt

A plain text file with one valid roll number per line. Only these roll numbers are allowed to mark attendance.

Example:

```
23BCS001
23BCS002
23BCS003
```

---

## 🗃️ Output File

* `attendance.csv`: Generated by the server and updated in real-time.
* Contains: Roll Number, Time of Entry

---

## 📦 Requirements

### For Python Files

* Python 3.x
* Tkinter (usually included with Python)
* No external libraries required

---

## ❗ Notes

* Run the server before any clients connect.
* `attendance.csv` is automatically created/overwritten each time the server starts.
* Roll numbers not listed in `valid_rolls.txt` will be rejected.
